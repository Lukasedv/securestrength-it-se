- **Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) - excellent for UI applications
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is specifically designed for screen reading with excellent legibility

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Timer and current action prominently displayed, secondary information subdued
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load during workouts
- **Grid System**: Card-based layout with consistent padding and spacing
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design suitable for gym use
- **Content Density**: Minimal information density to focus user attention

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions for state changes, countdown visual feedback
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Timer progress animations and button state changes
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal animations to avoid distraction during workouts

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: shadcn/ui components for consistency and accessibility
- **Component Customization**: Minimal customization to Tailwind defaults
- **Component States**: Clear visual feedback for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for clarity and consistency
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons for main actions, outline buttons for secondary actions
- **Spacing System**: Consistent Tailwind spacing scale throughout
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-friendly sizing and layout for gym environment

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with shadcn/ui
- **Style Guide Elements**: Consistent color usage, typography, and spacing
- **Visual Rhythm**: Regular spacing patterns and consistent component sizing
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional appearance suitable for both fitness and corporate training

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and interactive elements
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile use
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear states for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader**: Semantic HTML and proper labeling for accessibility

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Users might want to skip security questions or adjust rep counts quickly
- **Edge Case Handling**: Arrow controls for quick rep adjustment, skip option after correct answers
- **Technical Constraints**: Works offline, persists state between sessions

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Additional workout programs and security questions can be easily added
- **Testing Focus**: Timer accuracy, state persistence, quiz randomization
- **Critical Questions**: Does the integrated quiz feel natural during workouts?

## Recent Updates
- **Rep Input Enhancement**: Replaced text input with intuitive left/right arrow controls, defaulting to target rep count
- **UI Consolidation**: Integrated security quiz directly into the timer card for cleaner, more focused interface
- **State Management**: Enhanced session state to handle integrated quiz flow and rep adjustments
- **User Experience**: Streamlined interaction flow reduces cognitive load during workouts
- **CVE-Based Security Questions**: Implemented a comprehensive database of 20 security questions based on real, high-impact CVEs from recent years (2018-2024)
- **Question Variety**: Questions cover critical vulnerabilities like Log4Shell, PrintNightmare, Zerologon, and recent PAN-OS and OpenSSH flaws
- **Enhanced Learning**: Each question includes detailed explanations and CVE source information for deeper understanding
