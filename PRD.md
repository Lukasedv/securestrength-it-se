# Gym Timer App with IT Security Education

A focused workout timer application that combines Starting Strength methodology with IT security learning during rest periods.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Focused** - Clear, distraction-free interface that keeps users on track with their workout routine
2. **Educational** - Seamlessly integrates security knowledge without interrupting the fitness flow
3. **Motivating** - Gamified learning elements that make both fitness and security concepts engaging

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Combines timer functionality with educational content delivery, requiring state management for workouts, progress tracking, and learning modules

## Essential Features

**Workout Timer**
- Functionality: Customizable rest period timers between sets (typically 3-5 minutes for compound lifts)
- Purpose: Ensures proper recovery time following Starting Strength protocol
- Trigger: User completes a set and starts rest timer
- Progression: Select exercise → Set weight/reps → Complete set → Start timer → Learn during rest → Next set
- Success criteria: Timer counts down accurately, provides audio/visual alerts at completion

**IT Security Education Module**
- Functionality: Displays bite-sized security tips, concepts, and mini-quizzes during rest periods
- Purpose: Productive use of mandatory rest time to build cybersecurity knowledge
- Trigger: Rest timer starts automatically showing educational content
- Progression: Timer starts → Security tip appears → Optional quiz question → Timer completes → Return to workout
- Success criteria: Content is digestible within 3-5 minute windows, tracks learning progress

**Workout Tracking**
- Functionality: Log exercises, sets, reps, and weights following Starting Strength program structure
- Purpose: Track strength progression and maintain workout consistency
- Trigger: User selects workout day (A or B) and begins logging
- Progression: Select program day → Log each exercise → Record sets/reps/weight → Complete workout → View progress
- Success criteria: Data persists between sessions, shows progression over time

**Progress Dashboard**
- Functionality: Visual representation of both lifting progress and security knowledge gained
- Purpose: Motivate continued engagement with both fitness and learning goals
- Trigger: User navigates to progress section
- Progression: View dashboard → See lift progression charts → Review security topics completed → Set new goals
- Success criteria: Clear visual feedback on improvement in both domains

## Edge Case Handling

- **Timer Interruption**: Save current state if app is closed or phone call received during workout
- **Offline Usage**: Core timer and logging functions work without internet connection
- **Battery Optimization**: Prevent device sleep during active timer countdown
- **Invalid Inputs**: Validate weight/rep entries and provide helpful error messages
- **First-Time Users**: Guided onboarding explaining Starting Strength basics and app navigation

## Design Direction

The design should feel focused and purposeful like a professional training environment - clean, minimal interface that prioritizes functionality over decoration, with subtle gamification elements that reward both physical and knowledge gains without feeling childish.
